Haskell code examples - very much work in progress

There are two main parts

  * docker - create docker images containing Haskell. You can then run from the command line using 'docker run -v /localproject:/app haskell /bin/bash' to get a command line with Haskell installed. Avoids ensuring that yuo have the right version installed locally

  * tictactoe - A Tic-Tac-Toe game that is based on [Event Sourcing](https://github.com/cer/event-sourcing-examples)
